    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jérémie</h1>
    <h2>My top 4 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />

    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5979872/"> <h3>Bleach</h3> </a>
    <img src="../assets/FavMovie/Bleach.jpeg" alt="Bleach">
    <p>This is one my favorite anime-movie adaption although having not yet watched the anime. 
        All throughout the movie we are given hints on how dangerour the main caracter would be if he is not controlled.
        the ending is all contrary though.</p>
    <hr />

    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9777666/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_the%2520tom"> <h3>The Tomorrow War</h3> </a>
    <img src="../assets/FavMovie/TomorrowWar.jpeg" alt="Tomorrow War" height="200">
    <p> Very poignant and heart-breaking Sci-fi and action packed movie. The ending is tragic as it ends on the 
        loss of the actor's beloved wife in exchange for a win for humanity.</p>
    <hr />

    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_pacific%2520rim"> <h3>Pacific Rim</h3> </a>
    <img src="../assets/FavMovie/Pacific Rimjpeg.jpeg" alt="Pacific Rim" height="200" width="200">
    <p>A very futuristic and out of this world movie. The movie actually has everything to please its audience with
       high action packed fight scenes between humans and Kaijus(some sorts of aliens).
    </p>
    <hr />

    <a href="<h3>Pacific Rim</h3>"> <h3>Purple Hearts</h3> </a>
    <img src="../assets/FavMovie/Purpleheart.jpeg" alt="Purple Hearts" height="200">
        <p>Excellent start to the film which gives no signs of a possible love story at all but near the end
           the movie becomes a near drama emotional and climatic ending.</p>
